## Wishlist Info:

- The rolls in this wishlist do not account for barrel, mag, or masterwork unless they are essential to the roll's functionality as I realistically can't account for every ideal barrel, mag, perk and masterwork permutation since that would lead to upwards of tens of thousands of rolls and I'm just one guy (Plus they realistically don't change the roll much anyways besides a few exceptions that *have* been accounted for).
- Full Auto Trigger System has been excluded on all non-shotguns due to it being totally preference on most guns (Plus it's getting kinda replaced by the Full Auto Retrofit mod soon and will likely be reworked/replaced come Witch Queen anyways).
- Legacy refers to a weapon or roll that is currently unobtainable. Legacy weapons may be sold be Xur occasionally, however legacy rolls are likely to remain unobtainable forever as they are often the result of a perk pool change.
