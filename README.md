## Last update: December 13th, 2022
- Added all new weapons added with **Season of the Seraph** and **Spire of the Watcher**.
- Updated rolls for all **Deep Stone Crypt**, **IKELOS v1.0.3**, and **Dawning** weapons as well as **Hung Jury SR4**.

## How to add to DIM:

1) Open the [settings menu](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/settings) in DIM
2) Click on "Wish List" on the left side of the menu, or scroll down to the Wish Lists section
3) Paste the link to the [raw version of wishlist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zephyrr29/DIM-Wishlist/main/wishlist.txt) into the URL box
4) Click "Update Wish List Source"

Done!

To update the wishlist, simply click the "Update Wish List Source" button. Note that this sometimes won't work immediately after an update, you may have to give it like 5 minutes.

## Wishlist Info:

- The rolls in this wishlist do not account for barrel, mag, or masterwork unless they are essential to the roll's functionality as I don't believe they dramatically affect the weapon's performance.
- Full Auto Trigger System has been excluded on all non-shotguns due to it being totally preference on those guns.
- Legacy refers to a roll that is currently unobtainable due to a change in the weapon's perk pool. It may return in the future, it may not.
