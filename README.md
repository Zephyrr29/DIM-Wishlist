## Wishlist Info:

- The rolls in this wishlist do not account for barrel, mag, or masterwork unless they are essential to the roll's funcitonality.

- Full Auto Trigger System has been excluded on all non-shotguns due to it being totally preference on most guns.

- Legacy refers to a weapon or roll that is currently unobtainable. Legacy weapons may be sold be Xur occasionally, however legacy rolls are likely to remain unobtainable forever as they are often the result of a perk pool change.

- Curated Rolls are included, however this doesn't mean that all of them are good. They were included for the sake of completion since they often feature perks otherwise unobtainable.
