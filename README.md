## Last update: January 9th, 2022
- Removed Explosive Payload/Firefly as a roll for Fatebringer (Timelost) to allow other rolls to be highlighted.

## How to add to DIM:

1) Open the [settings menu](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/settings) in DIM
2) Click on "Wish Lists" on the left side of the menu, or scroll down to the Wish Lists section
3) Paste the link to the [raw version of wishlist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zephyrr29/DIM-Wishlist/main/wishlist.txt) into the URL box
4) Click "Update Wish List Source"

Done!

To update the wishlist, simply click the "Update Wish List Source" button. Note that this won't work immediately after an update, you'll have to give it like 5 minutes.

## Wishlist Info:

- The rolls in this wishlist do not account for barrel, mag, or masterwork unless they are essential to the roll's functionality as I realistically can't account for every ideal barrel, mag, perk and masterwork permutation since that would lead to upwards of tens of thousands of rolls and I'm just one guy (Plus they realistically don't change the roll *that* much anyways besides a few exceptions that *have* been accounted for).
- Full Auto Trigger System has been excluded on all non-shotguns due to it being totally preference on most guns and easily replaced by the Full Auto Retrofit mod.
- Legacy refers to a weapon or roll that is currently unobtainable. Legacy weapons may be sold be Xur occasionally, however legacy rolls are likely to remain unobtainable forever as they are often the result of a perk pool change that saw the combo removed entirely.
