## How to add to DIM:

1) Open the [settings menu](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/settings) in DIM
2) Click on "Wish Lists" on the left side of the menu, or scroll down to the Wish Lists section
3) Paste the link to the [raw version of wishlist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zephyrr29/DIM-Wishlist/main/wishlist.txt) into the URL box
4) Click "Update Wish List Source"

Done!

To update the wishlist, simply click the "Update Wish List Source" button. Note that this sometimes won't work immediately after an update, you may have to give it like 5 minutes.

## Wishlist Info:

- The rolls in this wishlist do not account for barrel, mag, or masterwork unless they are essential to the roll's functionality as I realistically can't account for every ideal barrel, mag, perk and masterwork permutation since that would lead to upwards of tens of thousands of rolls and I'm just one guy (Plus they realistically don't change the roll *that* much anyways besides a few exceptions that *have* been accounted for).
- Full Auto Trigger System has been excluded on all non-shotguns due to it being totally preference on most guns and easily replaced by the Full Auto Retrofit mod.
- Legacy refers to a roll that is currently unobtainable due to a change in the weapon's perk pool. It may return in the future, it may not.
- Weapons primarily obtained through crafting such as The Enigma, Osteo Striga, and the class Glaives are omitted due to how easily curated the rolls are making them much more preference based than others.
